# UPenn_Project2
This project was done by Hao Dong, Ana Stefanski, Michael McAneny-Binetsky, Vysh Nalluri, and Meredith Hopkins as part of the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp. Data on bird sightings and data on ufo sightings were collected from Cornell's eBird API 2.0 and Kaggle, respectively. The data was cleaned and procesed with Pandas in Jupyter Lab before being loaded into both PostgreSQL and MongoDB for storage. 

The first step in this project was to extract data. The group decided to find data on UFO sightings and data on bird sightings. The UFO sightings data was sourced from Kaggle and downloaded as a CSV. Obtaining the bird sightings data was a more complex process. Due to the volume of data available through the eBird API, at this stage in the project the group decided to restrict the data to a single US state - California - and the years 2003 to 2013. This API only allows up to 30 days worth of sightings data to be called at once so a nested for loop was used to call historical data.
