# UPenn_Project2
This project was done by Hao Dong, Ana Stefanski, Michael McAneny-Binetsky, Vysh Nalluri, and Meredith Hopkins as part of the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp. Data on bird sightings and data on ufo sightings were collected from Cornell's eBird API 2.0 and Kaggle, respectively. The data was cleaned and procesed with Pandas in Jupyter Lab before being loaded into both PostgreSQL and MongoDB for storage.
